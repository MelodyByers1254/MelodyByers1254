## Hi there 👋

Hi there! 👋 I’m a junior full-stack developer with a growing passion for building web applications that are functional, scalable, and user-friendly. This repository represents part of my learning journey as I work with Express.js on the backend and MongoDB as the database layer to develop full-stack applications.

I enjoy working across the stack, from designing RESTful APIs to handling data operations and connecting everything to a clean, responsive frontend. Express.js has been my go-to framework for creating lightweight, efficient server-side logic, while MongoDB allows for flexible, document-based data storage that works well for a wide variety of use cases.

This repo includes some of the projects, experiments, and mini apps I’ve built while practicing core concepts like routing, CRUD operations, middleware, database integration, authentication, and deployment. I’m learning how to structure applications cleanly, manage code with good practices, and write solutions that are easy to understand and extend.

I believe in learning by doing, so these projects are both exercises and stepping stones. I’m also exploring how to integrate third-party APIs, build secure login systems, and implement features like pagination, search, and data validation.

If you’re also learning full-stack development—or you’re just curious to see how I’m growing in this space—feel free to check out the code, open issues, or even contribute. I welcome feedback and suggestions that can help me (and others) improve and level up.

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s keep learning, building, and sharing code that solves real problems. 🖥️🚀💡
